The chess program is divided into engine (C++) and client (Python). Even though it is a work in progress, the master branch should contain a runnable version.
Currently it is possible to play a game against engine.

Building engine:   cd c_engine && cmake ./ && cmake --build ./
Running engine test suite:  ./tests
Running engine: ./engine PORT (port is used for communication with client, must be the same as in client)
Running client: python3 main.py PORT
